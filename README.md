# REST-API-Python

REST stands for representational state transfer and is a software architecture style that defines a pattern for client and server communications over a network. 
REST provides a set of constraints for software architecture to promote performance, scalability, simplicity, and reliability in the system.

REST defines the following architectural constraints: <br>
Stateless: The server wonâ€™t maintain any state between requests from the client. <br>
Client-server: The client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. <br>
Cacheable: The data retrieved from the server should be cacheable either by the client or by the server. <br>
Uniform interface: The server will provide a uniform interface for accessing resources without defining their representation. <br>
Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or load balancer.
